        <li>Half a cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>Half a teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>

    </ul>

    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 30 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li>Make cake: Mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Mix in sour cream, milk, food color, and vanilla. Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until just blended; do not overbeat. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the pans; cool completely.</li>
        <li>While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.</li>
    </ol>
